# Udacity Portfolio

This is the first project for the Front-End Development nanodegree. I have submitted this project in observation of the material as-is, but I will likely continue to iterate on my [design portfolio](https://github.com/asiahoe/portfolio) repository going forward.

## Instructions
- Download the design mockup file.
- Identify the various boxes you will need to build in order to recreate this design.
- Write your HTML and CSS files. Continue to iterate until your work is representative of the design mockup.
- Take the time to personalize your portfolio with custom colors, additional content and your own images.
- Validate your [HTML](http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) against the W3C's Validators. Note: the validators consider the following errors, whereas Udacity accepts these errors as acceptable:
	- HTML5: Bad value X-UA-Compatible for attribute http-equiv on element meta when using the X-UA-Compatible meta tag.
	- CSS3: Property [some property here] is an unknown vendor extension when using vendor prefixed properties (like -moz-box-sizing).
